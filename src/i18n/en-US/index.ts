  zoomInfo: "This animation creates a smooth zoom-in effect using GSAP's fromTo method. The element starts small and transparent with a light blue color, then scales up to three times its size while rotating nearly 360 degrees. The transition is powered by the back.out easing, which creates a dynamic bounce at the end of the zoom. The final state brings full opacity and a new color tone, giving the impression of growth and reveal.",

  flipInfo: 'This animation produces a flip rotation effect on a text element using GSAP and Vue 3. The effect simulates a 3D horizontal flip (rotationX) combined with scaling, opacity changes, and color transitions. It starts with a faded, small version of the element (opacity: 0.2, scale: 0.5), flips it 180 degrees while scaling up, and completes the cycle with a full 360-degree flip and a final color change. Each step is chained via gsap.timeline, ensuring smooth sequential transitions.',

  pulseInfo: 'This animation creates a subtle pulse effect on an element using GSAP in a Vue 3 (script setup) environment. The animation gradually adjusts the element\'s opacity, scale, and rotation through a sequence of eight smooth keyframes. These steps are chained inside a GSAP timeline and repeated four times to simulate a natural rhythmic pulse. The easing used (sine.inOut) ensures the transitions are smooth and organic, with the animation always ending in a neutral state: scale: 1, rotate: 0, and opacity: 1.',
  shake: 'Shake',
  shakeInfo: 'This animation simulates a dramatic 3D shake effect by applying small, rapid rotations on all three axes â€” rotationX, rotationY, and rotationZ. Each step introduces exaggerated angular movement, which is softened by a sinusoidal easing (sine.inOut). Additionally, a slight scale up reinforces the feeling of intensity. The sequence ends gracefully with the element returning to its original state.',
